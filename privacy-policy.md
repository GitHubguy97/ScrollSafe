# ScrollSafe Privacy Policy
_Last updated: 1 December 2025_

ScrollSafe is a Chrome extension that inspects short-form videos on YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok to check for AI-generated content. We respect your privacy and only collect the minimum information needed to provide the service.

## Information We Collect
- **Captured frames & metadata** – When you run a deep scan, the extension captures up to 8 video frames plus metadata such as video ID, platform, caption, hashtags, and channel name. These are sent securely to our backend (`https://api.scroll-safe.com`) for analysis.
- **Local history** – ScrollSafe stores a private history of the last five videos you scanned inside Chrome’s local storage so you can revisit them. This history never leaves your device unless you run a deep scan.

We do **not** collect personal identifiers, financial data, login credentials, geographic location, or browsing history beyond the videos you explicitly analyze.

## How We Use the Information
- Run AI detection on the captured frames and return a verdict to you.
- Improve the accuracy and reliability of ScrollSafe (e.g., aggregate performance metrics).
- Maintain temporary logs required for troubleshooting or security.

Captured frames are deleted automatically after deep-scan processing completes. Aggregate metrics contain no personal identifiers.

## Sharing
We do not sell or share your data with third parties. Frames and metadata are transmitted only to ScrollSafe’s servers for processing and are not accessible to advertising networks or analytics services.

## Security
All communication between the extension and our backend is encrypted via HTTPS. Access to backend systems is restricted to essential personnel.

## Your Choices
- You can clear the local session history from the popup at any time.
- Uninstalling the extension removes all locally stored data.
- If you do not initiate a deep scan, no frames or metadata leave your device.

## Contact
If you have privacy questions or requests, email us at **gideon.living@gmail.com**.
